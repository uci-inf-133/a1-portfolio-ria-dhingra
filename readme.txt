--Readme document for *Ria Dhingra*, *dhingrr1@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 1/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
I have at least one image, with a descriptive alt attribute.
I have a link to an external page.
I have multiple pages with appropriate navigation between them.



(b) CSS features
I added/ modified padding and margins on every page to make the text/ titles easily readable.
I also modified the color of the "here" where the Devpost is linked on the Projects page.
I also used a custom font from Google Fonts.



(c) Advanced features
I added a navigation bar to every page (Home, Projects, Resume, Contact).
I embedded a video, showcasing a live demo of my project.
I built a contact form with HTML forms.




3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I ignored the potential issues given by the Accessibility Checker. After evaluating these issues, I determined that they do not pose a real 
accessibility concern for their respective pages:
    a. index.html:
    --> image alt text: ignored these because my alt text was descriptive enough since my image was simply a portait of myself, nothing more, nothing less.
    --> text direction/ Unicode markers: ignored this, because the html page already specifies lang="en"
    --> visual lists/ skip links: ignored these because this is a small portfolio with only a few pages to navigate. it is nothing complex.
    --> color/ sensory characteristics: ignored these because my page doesn't rely on color or visual position to convey any information

    b. contact.html:
    --> text direction/ Unicode markers: ignored this, because the html page already specifies lang="en"
    --> label proximity/ descriptions: ignored, because all inputs are clearly labeled and grouped
    --> color: ignored because nothing is communicate through the color alone; the labels/ input handle this
    --> navigation issues: ignored because this is a small portfolio with only a few pages to navigate. it is nothing complex.
    --> headings/ sensory characteristics: ignored because headings are used semantically

    c. projects.html:
    --> text direction/ Unicode markers: ignored this, because the html page already specifies lang="en"
    --> visual links/ sensory characteristics: ingored because all information is presented with clear headings and text
    --> navigation issues: ignored because this is a small portfolio with only a few pages to navigate. it is nothing complex.
    --> page title/ link purpose: ignored because titles and links are descriptive in context

    d. resume.html:
    --> text direction/ Unicode markers: ignored this, because the html page already specifies lang="en"
    --> visual lists/ skip links: ignored these because this is a small portfolio with only a few pages to navigate. it is nothing complex.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I worked on this assignment over the course of 3 days. Each day, I set aside 3-4 hours to work on developing my portfolio.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I consulted the resources for HTML tags and CSS styling on the course website. 
I also search up how I can implement certain features on my screen, like on the resume page, each box becomes bolded when I hover over it for 0.2 seconds.
I used the internet mainly for quick "how do i?" type questions, and referred to all the materials on the course website for further help.


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I did not consult any classmate or individual as part of this assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
N/A.
